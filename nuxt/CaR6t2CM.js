    IRC: Cloudzy allows Dedicated Server customers the use of IRC inside the Cloudzy network as long as the use of IRC on a Cloudzy server does not violate any of the other terms of these TOS. As a policy, Cloudzy will not provide vanity IRC reverse DNS records. To enforce this policy Cloudzy does not turn the reverse address of IPs over to the customer. Authority over this information remains with Cloudzy. Billing for Network Resources: The customer understands that the customer is responsible for paying for any network resources that are used to connect the customer’s server to the Internet. The customer may request that the customer’s server be disconnected from the Internet, but the customer will still be responsible for paying for any network resources used up to the point of suspension or cancellation.`},{title:"Media",description:"If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included.
